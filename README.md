# DogGrooming_WCF

This is the back end of the doggrooming website. It's a .NET WCF service that's been modified to work like a REST API. At the time of writing this I didn't know how to create rest APIs in .NET.

This project interacts with a mysql relational database, and sends back information when the front end needs it. It is also responsible for sending verification emails, upon successful, registration of new accounts, and successful appointment booking.

This was a uni assignment
